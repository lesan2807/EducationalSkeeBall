# Educational Skee Ball 

This is an educational game based on trigonometry. The user must apply his knowledge in angles to give direction to the balls and try to sink them in the different holes that will appear on the board. Depending on the size and color of the hole, the player can win points, win balls, loose points or loose balls. 
The player begins with 3 balls. He writes an angle in the text box given. It will be on degrees or radians, depending on how he decides to play the game. The player then presses the button "Shoot" and watches the shooter rotate in that angle. 
The ball will move in a straight line. If it hits a hole, the score can increase, decrease, or the number of shots can increase or decrease. 
When the player has no more balls left, the board is reset. 
The player moves on with the next level when he attains 2000 points. If he is out of shots, the starting angle of the shooter will be reset. 
The player wins when he completes all levels in degrees and radians.  

The game starts with a Main Menu in which you can select from three options: Start, Levels, or Exit. \

The holes that do not have balls, will have points labeled. Some will be positive and will and to the score, others will be negative and will decrease the score. 

The player can play a level as many times he wants. \
In order to unlock the Radians option, the player will have to pass the level in Degrees. \
If the player wins the level in Degrees, he can play the next level in Degrees but not in Radians. 
In order to play the next level in Radians, the player must win the previous level in Radians.
