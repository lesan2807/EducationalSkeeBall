# Educational Skee Ball 

This is an educational game based on trigonometry. The user must apply his knowledge in angles to give direction to the balls and try to sink them in the different holes that will appear on the board.

## Rules

Player begins with 3 balls. 
Player writes angle (degrees or radians) in a text box and presses the button "Shoot" and watches the shooter rotate in that angle. 
The ball will move in that angle. If it hits a circle the player earns points. 
When the player has no more balls left, the board is reset. 
The player wins when he gets 5000 points. 

## Score
