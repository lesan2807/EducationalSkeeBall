# Educational Skee Ball 

This is an educational game based on trigonometry. The user must apply his knowledge in angles to give direction to the balls and try to sink them in the different holes that will appear on the board. Depending on the size and color of the hole, the player can win points, win balls, loose points or loose balls. 
The player begins with 3 balls. He writes an angle in the text box given. It will be on degrees or radians, depending on how he decides to play the game. The player then presses the button "Shoot" and watches the shooter rotate in that angle. 
The ball will move in a straight line. If it hits a hole, the score can increase, decrease, or the number of shots can increase or decrease. 
When the player has no more balls left, the board is reset. 
The player moves on with the next level when he attains the minimum points in order to pass each level. If he is out of shots, the starting angle of the shooter will be reset. 
The player wins when he completes all levels in degrees and radians.  

The game starts with a Main Menu in which you can select from three options: Start, Levels, or Exit. \

If the player chooses the Start button, the initial level will show up. This level is in degrees.  \

If the player chooses the Levels button, the Level menu will appear. \
If the player presses the "D" button, the level will be loaded in degrees mode. \
If the player presses the "R" button, the level will be loaded in radians mode.

The different types of holes in the game are: \

The holes that do not have balls, will be color coded. Some will be in green tones, and will add to the score, others will be in red tones, and will decrease the score. The holes with black balls will remove the number of balls you have. The holes with white balls will add to the number of balls you have. 

The different levels in the game are: \

Each level has a minimun of points to win the level: \ 
Level 1: 300 \
Level 2: 500 \
Level 3: 700 \
Level 4: 900 \
Level 5: 1100 \
Level 6: 1300 \
Level 7: 1500 \
Level 8: 1700 \
Level 9: 1900 \
Level 10: 2100 \


The player can play a level as many times he wants. \
In order to unlock the Radians option, the player will have to pass the level in Degrees. \
If the player wins the level in Degrees, he can play the next level in Degrees but not in Radians. 
In order to play the next level in Radians, the player must win the previous level in Radians. 

## Future work
* Add textures to figures (balls, holes, canon). 
* Add fractions to the angle input.
* Scale window when enlarged or shrinked.
